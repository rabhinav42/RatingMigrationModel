Short description of the programs:
1. sim_phase.m simulates one phase transition path
2. sim_ratings.m simulates one migration path. i.e, simulates rating migrations for all considered 
companies given a phase transition path.
3. sim_res.m is the main program where we provide the transition matrix for both phase and rating
migrations for the simulation. ME and MC estimated here and PD for CCC also plotted
(simply modify the row number to get the PD plot for any rating).
